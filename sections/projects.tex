\subsection{Analysis of Historical Data of National Football Teams 
\hspace{0.1 cm} \href{https://github.com/juanjogervasio/Data-Analytics-Coderhouse}{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{github-mark.png}}
}
Transformation and analysis of public data on national football teams available in \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017}{kaggle.com}, aiming to obtain an evaluation criteria for the teams performance and to establish a ranking to compare with the one developed by \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashncarry/fifaworldranking}{FIFA}. The first data transformation was made using Excel and SQL, and the analysis and presentation of the results were performed in Power BI.

\subsection{Monte Carlo simulations of a simple traffic model
\hspace{0.1 cm} \href{https://github.com/juanjogervasio/Monte-Carlo-traffic-simulation}{\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{github-mark.png}}
}
Analysis of a simple traffic model that includes random driver behaviour for better agreement with real traffic. Different scenarios were simulated by changing probabilities and the maximum velocities, and the fundamental diagrams were obtained. This project was developed using Python.
